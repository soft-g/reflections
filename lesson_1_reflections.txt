I went dowm line by line and was told in the instructions to look for a spelling error. After I found a spelling error I confirmed the difference in both versions

Having easy access to afiles changes could make it easier to see he order that problems were solved and simplify the code review by looking at less complicated code to more dense code.

There is a better logical relationship between manual commits than automated commits.

Git is for computer programs while google is for documents

git log can be used to search for changes in commit text and git diff can be used to compare versions

Using version control allows more confidence because a last good version can be more quickly retrieved

I want to use git when writing complex managedcode or working together with others to complet larger tasks
