When would you want to add remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you wish to access you work from more than one device or location and also when a repository has more than one contributor.

You might not want automated pulls because you know where you are in a project and don't want to be confused.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use forking to clone a git repository on Github, use cloning to copy a repository to your working folder, use branching when adding commits to you working folder.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It tells you whether ther people are making commits and lets you know if you are out of sync.
