When you initialize a repository a git metadata file is created. This must be done to track the files in your repository.

Working directory is a logical location of files that may or may not be included in a repository. Staging area includes files that will be comitted.

Compare the staged diff to the previous commit.

Branches can be useful to try out new things while leaving the main code intact. Helping to better organize a project.

Diagrams make Branches visually accessible and help keep track of side branches.

Merging is fucked up and has to be done just right or else shit is fucked. Shit was fucked.

Automatic merging can sometimes simplify things. Other times it creates a mess.
